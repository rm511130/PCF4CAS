## Value Statement
- Enterprises rely on software to improve business outcomes.
- They depend on velocity of converting ideas to new features, new applications, new capabilities, and new services.
- This pace of change is generating a daunting backlog of work for IT leaders, who are also under pressure to reduce technology spend and limit security vulnerabilities.
- These competing mandates - velocity, security, and operational efficiency - force enterprises to re-evaluate how they develop, architect, and operate software. 
- Pivotal meets enterprises wherever they are on this journey and helps them accelerate their transition to continuous delivery, reducing waste (costs and time) through process and automation to achieve world-class efficiency and productivity.
- The business outcomes that Pivotalâ€™s customers are achieving are compelling by any standard.
